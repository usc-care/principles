## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline and codify some general principles for working with data on projects with a quantitative component at Gibson Consulting Group. The intended audience is Gibson quantitative researchers, though many of the procedures and principles we discuss throughout the document reflect universal guidelines for managing workflows for applied research projects. Some are more parochial, though, such as our computing architecture, naming conventions, and folder structure and organization.

This document is inspired, and borrows heavily, from similar guides for applied researchers, including Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro's [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practicioner's Guide](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/CodeAndData.pdf) and Julian Reif's [Stata Coding Guide](https://julianreif.com/guide/).

The document reflects the contributions of current and past Gibson researchers, including Danial Hoepfner, Eric Booth, David Osman, Marshall Garland, and Jill Carle.

## Location
